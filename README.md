# Pong Game
Pong Game is a game i spent very little time on to practice my physics. Very unoriginal and simple game.

The ball goes at a steeper angle and at a faster speed the more to the edge of the paddle you hit it at. When scored, the ball always goes to the victors side at the same place. Too lazy to make a bot game even though probably wouldn't have been hard.

Disclaimer: Could've made it look better but I was too lazy. Also messy asf sorry.

Disclaimer 2: The numbers for the sizes may look messy and I was too lazy to comment everything i did, but if the viewer thinks hard enough the numbers aren't messy anymore. Also was too lazy to add a score reset button so just restart code when you want to reset score.
